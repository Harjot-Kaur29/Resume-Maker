# Resume-Maker
This is a project build using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap . It takes input from user and generate resume.
I have taken help from a tutorial and developed this web application. I have created a form for users where they can enter their personal and professional details.
After that they can click on generate cv button and it will generate cv in form of template.
It also have a print cv button which will help to download the resume in our system.
